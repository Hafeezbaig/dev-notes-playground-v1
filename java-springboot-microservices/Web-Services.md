### 1. **What is a Web Service?**

A **web service** is a **software system** designed to enable **interoperable machine-to-machine interaction** over a **network** (usually the internet).

This means:

* It is not designed for humans, but for systems to talk to each other.
* It is accessed through standard protocols (like HTTP).
* It returns data in a machine-readable format, not in HTML.

#### Common Misunderstanding:

A website you visit on your browser is **not** a web service. Even though it's delivered over the web, it delivers **HTML** for human interaction. A true web service is for system-level consumption, not direct human browsing.

### 2. **Why HTML-Based Applications Are Not Web Services**

When your application returns **HTML**, it’s rendered in a browser and is intended for users. Other applications **cannot easily consume HTML** because:

* HTML is not structured for machine parsing.
* It lacks semantic clarity for programmatic access.

Example:
You have a To-Do web app that returns HTML. A friend building a social media app wants to reuse your To-Do logic. They cannot consume your HTML output inside their app.

### 3. **Why Sharing JAR Files Is Not a Web Service Approach**

Another idea might be to share your internal logic via a **JAR file** (compiled Java code). This leads to many issues:

* **Tight coupling**: The consuming application needs to be Java-based.
* **Environment duplication**: They must replicate your DB, queue systems, configurations, etc.
* **Maintainability issues**: Every change in your app needs a new JAR to be shared, tested, and integrated.
* **Lack of interoperability**: A .NET or Python-based system cannot use the JAR at all.

This is not scalable, flexible, or maintainable.

### 4. **True Definition of a Web Service (W3C)**

> A **web service** is a software system designed to support **interoperable** machine-to-machine interaction **over a network**.

#### Three Essential Properties:

1. **Machine-to-Machine Interaction**

   * It is not built for human consumption through browsers.
   * Other applications interact with it using APIs.

2. **Interoperability**

   * The service must work across different platforms and languages.
   * It should not matter whether the consumer is built using Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.

3. **Network Communication**

   * Services must be reachable over a network (usually via HTTP).
   * This enables distributed systems (e.g., Microservices).

---

### 5. **How to Achieve Interoperability**

This is achieved through **platform-independent data formats**:

* **JSON**: Lightweight, easy to parse, most common today.
* **XML**: Heavier but still widely used, especially in legacy systems.

The communication happens through:

* A **request** sent by the consumer
* A **response** sent by the service provider

Both request and response must follow a standard format (JSON or XML), ensuring the data can be interpreted regardless of platform or language.

### 6. **Key Web Service Terminologies**

| Term                          | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Request**                   | The input sent to a web service (usually JSON/XML)           |
| **Response**                  | The output sent back by the service                          |
| **Message Format**            | Defines how request/response is structured (e.g., JSON, XML) |
| **Service Provider / Server** | The system providing the web service                         |
| **Consumer / Client**         | The system consuming the web service                         |

### 7. **Two Types of Web Services**

#### 1. SOAP Web Services

* Stands for **Simple Object Access Protocol**
* Communication format is **SOAP XML**, which follows strict schemas
* Requires:

  * **SOAP Envelope**
  * **SOAP Header**
  * **SOAP Body** (actual content)
* Platform-independent but verbose and rigid
* Still used in enterprise, banking, and government systems

Example use case: A bank’s internal transaction processing between services.

#### 2. RESTful Web Services (REST APIs)

* REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**

* It is an architectural style built on top of **HTTP**

* Instead of enforcing a format, it leverages standard HTTP methods:

  | HTTP Method | Operation   | Example    |
  | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
  | GET         | Read data   | `/todos/5` |
  | POST        | Create data | `/users`   |
  | PUT/PATCH   | Update data | `/todos/5` |
  | DELETE      | Delete data | `/todos/5` |

* REST APIs are lightweight, easier to consume, and fit naturally into web architecture

Example use case: A mobile app fetching user data from a REST API.

### 8. **REST vs SOAP: Conceptual Differences**

| Feature              | SOAP                                 | REST                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Communication Format | SOAP XML (strict structure)          | JSON / XML (flexible)            |
| Protocol Support     | Can use HTTP, SMTP, more             | HTTP only                        |
| Complexity           | High (due to strict XML and tooling) | Low (simple, readable, flexible) |
| Performance          | Heavier, slower                      | Lightweight, fast                |
| Use Case             | Enterprise apps, legacy systems      | Web, mobile apps, microservices  |

### 9. **Why REST is Preferred in Microservices**

* Microservices are meant to be small, independently deployable units.
* REST allows services to interact with each other with minimal coupling.
* REST over HTTP makes services easy to scale, monitor, test, and debug.
